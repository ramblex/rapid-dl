Rapidshare downloader
=====================

Download files from rapidshare. These scripts are based on work by Mark
Sullivan (http://www.markontech.com/). Consists of 2 scripts: download.rb and
monitor.sh

Pre-requisites:
---------------
- Choice rubygem (install using `gem install choice`)
- A premium rapidshare account
- Ruby 1.8 or 1.9

Setup:
------

Firstly, the script needs to be able to login to your rapidshare account. In
order to do this run the download.rb script with the following arguments:

./download.rb --user=MYUSERNAME --password=MYPASSWORD

This will store a cookie in a file called rapidshare in the current
directory. Note that this process only needs to be done once (providing that
the rapidshare cookie file exists).

Downloading: download.rb
------------------------

To download a single file from rapidshare use the following command (replacing
the URL with the URL of the file to download)

./download.rb --url=MYURL

This will print out the actual download URL and then begin downloading the file
in the background.

Alternatively, if you wish to download multiple files, put the URLs into a text
file (one URL per line) and use the following command:

./download.rb --file=myfile.txt

This will download all of the files listed in myfile.txt simultaneously.

To monitor the progress of the download(s) use the monitor.sh script:

Monitoring: monitor.sh
----------------------

./monitor.sh 

The above command will monitor all of the current downloads and will update
every 10 seconds by default. In order to change how often the script updates,
give a number as the first argument. For example, to make the script update
every 2 seconds, use:

./monitor.sh 2

Cancelling:
-----------

In order to cancel a download use ps and kill as follows:

ps -ax | grep wget

Find the process number of the wget and use

kill -9 <PID>
